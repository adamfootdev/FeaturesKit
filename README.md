FeaturesKit provides developers for Apple platforms with the ability to display a list of configured features in their apps. This is built using SwiftUI so can be displayed natively from a SwiftUI app or using a UIHostingController in a UIKit app, and has been designed to mimic the style of built-in Apple screens.

This has been localised into multiple languages and the buttons will automatically adapt to your app ºs accent color.

## Requirements

- iOS/iPadOS 15.0+
- macOS 13.0+
- tvOS 15.0+
- watchOS 8.0+
- Xcode 12.0+

## Integration

### Swift Package Manager

FeaturesKit can be added to your app via Swift Package Manager in Xcode. Add to your project like so:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/adamfootdev/FeaturesKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Usage

To start using the framework, you'll need to import it first:

```swift
import FeaturesKit
```

### FKConfiguration

This is a struct containing all of the relevant details required to configure FeaturesKit. It can be created like so:

```swift
let configuration = FKConfiguration(
    title: "What's New in Example App", 
    items: items, 
    showContinueButton: true, 
    continueButtonTitle: "Continue",
) {
    print("Done")
}
```

### FKItem

This is a struct containing details relating to items that appear on the feature list screen. It can be created as follows:

```swift
let item = FKItem(
    title: "New Feature", 
    description: "This is a cool new feature!", 
    systemImage: "checkmark.circle", 
    imageTint: .green
)
```

The systemImage value is optional and will be hidden if a value is not provided. The imageTint value is also optional and will default to the accent color if not provided.

### FeaturesView

The features view allows you to display a list of features that are available in your app with a custom title at the top. Create an instance of the view using the following:

```swift
FeaturesView(configuration: configuration)
```
